# Project Documentation

## Overview

This document provides instructions on how to replicate the work for this project. To ensure a smooth replication process, please follow the steps outlined below.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have Python and R installed on your system.

## Setup Instructions

To replicate the work, please perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Organize Project Files

- Keep all datasets and code files in the same directory.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

- **Python Dependencies**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the required Python libraries:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements_python.txt
  ```

- **R Dependencies**: Install the required R packages by running the following command in your terminal:

  ```
  R -e "install.packages(readLines('requirements_R.txt'))"
  ```

### Step 3: Interactive Execution

- **Python Code**: Preferably run the Python code in an interactive environment such as Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

- **R Code**: For R scripts, it's recommended to use RStudio or an equivalent R interactive environment.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to adjust file paths in the scripts according to your directory structure if they differ from the defaults.
- Check the documentation within individual code files for more specific running instructions or prerequisites.
