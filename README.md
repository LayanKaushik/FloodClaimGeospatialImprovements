## Overview

This project enhances FEMAâ€™s NFIP V2 flood insurance claims dataset through:

- Generation of new geographic units from historical and modern shapefiles  
- Spatial anomaly detection using various machine learning techniques  
- Augmentation of missing location data with heuristics and modeling  
- Crosswalk creation across decades (1980â€“2020) for geographic consistency  
- Feature engineering for improved flood damage prediction and analysis  

---

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **FIMA NFIP Redacted Claims - Version 2** dataset, provided by FEMA via the OpenFEMA platform. This dataset contains over 2 million flood insurance claims from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), spanning multiple decades. Personally identifiable information has been redacted.

Key fields include:

- Claim amounts (building, contents, ICC)
- Water depth and cause of damage
- Flood zone and community identifiers
- Property characteristics (e.g., number of units, replacement cost)
- Event designation numbers and disaster indicators

The dataset is provided in CSV and Parquet formats and is updated periodically.

**Note:** FEMA source datasets and shapefiles are not included in this repository.
